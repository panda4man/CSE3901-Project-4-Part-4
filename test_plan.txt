Description: This document outlines the testing done in order to validate the Tic-Tac-Toe game
================

Testing Records:

The game uses an array to keep track of selected squares.

The Tic Tac Toe game was tested in multiple web browers to make sure it would work for users using different web browers.


The game was tested to make sure certain combinations of squares would promt the correct reuslt.

The combination of board[0] board[1] board[2] for "O" prompts as a loss for the user (player X). This is the correct result.
A board consiting of 0 three in a row combinations prompts as a tie (Cat's) game.  This is the correct result.
All other three in a row combinations were tested to make sure a win prompt was executed.
Along with these tests console.log() was used to make sure the selected square was correlating to the correct index of the array.
These were taken out after testing was completed.

Another test was to have the user select a square that has already been selected by either "X" or "O"
This resulted in a prompt saying that square has already been taken.  This is the correct result.
This scenario was tested when multiple X's and O's were on the board as well as when there was only one X and one O on the board.
